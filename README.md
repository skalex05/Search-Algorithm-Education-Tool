# Search-Algorithm-Education-Tool
This is a piece of software I built for my A Level coursework. 

It allows users to create graphs from nodes and weighted edges.
Users can then perform Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms.
The program provides step-by-step, written explanations and visual animations for each algorithm.

The repository includes a document created alongside the development process and can provide more details about how the software works.
