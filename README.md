# Search-Algorithm-Education-Tool
This is a piece of software I built for my A Level coursework. 

It allows users to create graphs from nodes and weighted edges.
Users can then perform Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms.
The program provides step by step, written explanations and visual animations to explain each algorithm.

The repository includes a document that was created alongside the development process and can provide more details about how the software works.
